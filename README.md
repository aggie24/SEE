# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. This calculator adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides with style! 😎

## Features ✨
- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication
- ➗ Division
- Supports decimal numbers
- Fun emoji-powered output

## How to Use 🚀
1. Run the Python script
2. Enter your first number when prompted
3. Enter your second number when prompted
4. See the magic happen! The calculator will display:
   - The sum of your numbers
   - The difference between them
   - The product
   - The quotient

## Example 💡
```
Enter the first number: 10

## Running the Calculator ▶️
Simply execute the Python script:
```bash
python fun_calculator.py
```

## Contribution 🤝
Feel free to fork and improve this calculator! Some ideas:
- Add more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)
- Implement error handling for division by zero
- Make it a continuous calculator that doesn't exit after one operation

Happy calculating! 🧮✨
